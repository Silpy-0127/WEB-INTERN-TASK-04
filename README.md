# Mobile-Friendly Website

## Description
This project makes an existing desktop website responsive and mobile-friendly using CSS media queries.

## What I Did
- Added media queries for screens 768px wide and smaller.
- Changed layouts to stack vertically on small screens.
- Made fonts smaller on mobile.
- Made navigation menu stack vertically.
- Ensured images resize to fit their containers.
- Tested responsiveness using Chrome DevTools.

## How to Test
Open the HTML file in a browser and resize the window or use the device toolbar in Chrome DevTools.
